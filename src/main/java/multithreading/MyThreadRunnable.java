		* ðŸ”¹ Thread.start() Flow (High-Level)
		*
		* 1. thread.start() â†’ defined in Java (Thread.java).
		*    - Checks thread state.
		*    - Calls private native method start0().
		*
		* 2. start0() â†’ 'native' means implemented in C/C++ inside JVM (not Java code).
		*    - Declared in Java, but body exists in JVM's libjvm (C/C++).
		*    - JVM uses JNI mechanism to connect Java â†” native code.
		*
		* 3. Native code (C/C++) â†’ uses OS APIs (pthread_create on Linux/Mac, CreateThread on Windows)
		*    to actually create a new OS-level thread.
		*
		* 4. New OS thread â†’ JVM runtime schedules it â†’ calls Thread.run().
		*    - If Runnable target exists, target.run() is executed in the new thread.
		*
		* ðŸ”¹ Key Point: 
		* Native methods in Java (like start0) act as bridges into the JVMâ€™s C/C++ code.
		* This is how Java leverages low-level system resources while keeping Java code platform-independent.

		/*
		 *
		 * ðŸ”¹ Thread vs Runnable â€” Why Runnable is Preferred
		 *
		 * 1. Thread class
		 *    - If we extend Thread, our task is tied directly to the thread object.
		 *    - We cannot extend any other class (Java allows only single inheritance).
		 *    - Reusability is poor: the task cannot easily be reused in thread pools or other contexts.
		 *    - âœ… When to use: Only if you want to customize thread behavior itself
		 *      (e.g., override start(), set up thread-specific fields, or for very quick demos/tests).
		 *
		 * 2. Runnable interface
		 *    - Runnable separates "what to do" (task) from "how to run it" (Thread).
		 *    - A class can implement Runnable and still extend another class.
		 *    - The same Runnable can be reused in multiple Threads, Executors, or even run synchronously.
		 *    - âœ… When to use: Almost always. Runnable (or Callable) is the standard way
		 *      to define tasks for Threads, Executors, and thread pools.
		 *
		 * ðŸ”¹ Key Point:
		 * We prefer Runnable mainly to avoid violating single inheritance
		 * and to make tasks reusable and flexible across different execution contexts.
