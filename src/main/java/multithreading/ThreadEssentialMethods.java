*
* ðŸ”¹ Java Thread Concepts & Methods â€” Quick Notes
*
* 1) User Thread
*    - Default type of thread created in Java (e.g., main thread, worker threads).
*    - JVM keeps running as long as at least one user thread is alive.
*
* 2) Daemon Thread
*    - Special background service thread (e.g., garbage collector).
*    - JVM exits when only daemon threads remain.
*    - Method: setDaemon(true) â†’ instance method (called on a Thread object).
*    - Method: isDaemon() â†’ instance method.
*
* 3) yield()
*    - Hints scheduler to pause current thread and allow others to run.
*    - Static method â†’ called on Thread class (Thread.yield()).
*
* 4) interrupt()
*    - Politely asks a thread to stop.
*    - Method: interrupt() â†’ instance method (called on a Thread object).
*    - Method: isInterrupted() â†’ instance method (checks specific thread).
*    - Method: Thread.interrupted() â†’ static method (checks & clears current threadâ€™s interrupt flag).
*
* 5) join()
*    - Makes the calling thread wait until the target thread finishes.
*    - Method: join(), join(ms) â†’ instance methods (called on a Thread object).
*
* 6) setPriority(int) / getPriority()
*    - Sets/gets a threadâ€™s scheduling priority (1..10).
*    - Methods: setPriority(), getPriority() â†’ instance methods.
*
* 7) setName(String) / getName()
*    - Sets/gets a threadâ€™s human-friendly name.
*    - Methods: setName(), getName() â†’ instance methods.
*
* ðŸ”¹ Key Point:
* - Instance methods â†’ called on a specific Thread object (t1.start(), t1.join(), t1.interrupt(), etc.).
* - Static methods â†’ called on the Thread class itself (Thread.sleep(), Thread.yield(), Thread.interrupted()).
* - User threads keep JVM alive; daemon threads do not.
* - yield() is only a hint, not a guarantee.
* - interrupt() sets a flag or throws InterruptedException if blocked.
* - join() is essential for thread coordination.
* - Priority and name help with scheduling hints and debugging clarity.
